# UniPass V2 Exit

UniPass V2 has been deprecated, and is no longer supported. You can upgrade to UniPass V3, or use this tool to transfer your assets to a new wallet.

## Quick Start

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Development

UniPass v2 is not available on the testnet, so there is a mock Connector that simulates the UniPass v2 Connector via Secp256k1 private key. You can change the private key `testPrivateKey` in the local storage, or use the default private key `0xeeeeeeee...eeeeeeee` to test
